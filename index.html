        This page doesn’t try to impress you. It’s just a soft corner of the web
        where things are calm, readable, and honest. You can scroll a little,
        breathe a little, and then go back to whatever you were doing.

        Sometimes a simple picture is enough to slow your brain down for a second.
        This one is here just for that.
